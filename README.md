## 1. OUR SERVICES
The **Bible Streak** App provides tools for Bible study, meditation, habit tracking, and digital wellbeing through "Focus Shielding" technology.
The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
**Screen Time & Focus Shielding:**
The App utilizes Apple's **Screen Time API** and **Family Controls** to block access to other applications on your device based on your settings ("Focus Shielding"). By using these features, you expressly consent to this functionality. We are not responsible for any missed communications, notifications, or inability to access other apps during active blocking sessions. You acknowledge that you have voluntary control over these settings and can grant or revoke these permissions in your device settings.
