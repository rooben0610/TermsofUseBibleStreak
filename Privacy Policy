## 1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
### Personal information you disclose to us
We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the Services (via **Firebase Authentication**), express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products, or otherwise when you contact us.
*   **Identifiers:** Names, email addresses, and usernames.
*   **Authentication Data:** Login credentials from third-party services (Apple ID, Google).
*   **Sensitive Information:** Religious beliefs (e.g., your selection of Bible reading plans, meditation sessions, and scripture bookmarks).
*   **Payment Data:** All payment data is handled and stored securely by **Apple/RevenueCat**. We do not store your credit card or billing details on our servers.
### Application Data
If you use our application, we also may collect the following information:
*   **Mobile Device Data:** We automatically collect device information (such as your mobile device ID, model, and manufacturer), operating system, and system configuration information. This is used via **Firebase Analytics** to troubleshoot and improve the app.
*   **Push Notifications:** We may request to send you push notifications regarding your reading streaks, reminders, or social interactions with friends.
*   **Screen Time / Device Usage:** The app requests access to Apple's **Family Controls/Managed Settings** API to provide "Focus Shielding" functionality. This data is used *locally* on your device to block distracting apps and is not transmitted to our servers for the purpose of monitoring your personal browsing history.
## 2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
We process your information to:
*   **Provide Services:** Syncing your reading progress across devices.
*   **Facilitate Social Features:** Allowing you to pair with "Partners" or add "Friends" to see shared progress.
*   **Analytics:** Using **Firebase Analytics** to understand user engagement and improve app features.
*   **Communicate:** Sending you account-related updates or support responses.
## 3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON?
We process your information based on:
*   **Consent:** When you explicitly allow us to process your data or sensitive information.
*   **Performance of a Contract:** To provide the "Bible Streak" service you signed up for.
*   **Legitimate Interests:** To improve our app and maintain security.
## 4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR DATA?
We may share your data with:
*   **Service Providers:** Third-party vendors that provide services for us (e.g., **Firebase** for backend/hosting/analytics and **RevenueCat/Apple** for payments).
*   **Cloud Hosting:** **Google Cloud/Firebase** stores your profile and streak data.
*   **Partners/Friends:** If you use the social features, your display name and reading progress may be visible to those you have specifically paired with.
## 5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND TRACKING?
We do not use traditional web cookies in the mobile app, but we use **mobile device identifiers** and **Firebase SDKs** to track app performance and user behavior.
## 6. HOW DO WE HANDLE SOCIAL LOGINS?
If you register via **Apple** or **Google**, we receive certain profile information (like your email and name). We use this only to facilitate your account creation and sync.
## 7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
We keep your information as long as your account is active. You can request account deletion via the App Settings at any time, which will remove your data from our active databases.
## 8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
We utilize **Firebase's secure infrastructure** to protect your data. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.
## 9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?
We do not knowingly collect data from children under 18 years of age. If we learn we have collected such data, we will deactivate the account and delete the data.
## 10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?
Depending on your region (EEA, UK, Canada), you have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. Contact us at **reachlyapps@gmail.com** to exercise these rights.
